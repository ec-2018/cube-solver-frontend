# [Cube Solver Web App](https://cube-solver-frontend.vercel.app/)
This is react web application that uses [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [react three fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) to render an interactive rubiks cube. TailwindCSS is used for styling the rest of the website. The user can either scramble a cube themselves or input the colors of a physical cube. In either case, the cube configuration information is sent to the backend server where it's processesd and a solve sequence is sent back in response. The details of how the cube is solved can be found in the repo for the backend server [here](https://github.com/ec-2018/cube-solver-backend).
